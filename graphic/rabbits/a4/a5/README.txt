1.I made a extra sphere with pure refraction which is the leftest one
2.made 10 bubbles by 
firstly, combined  refract() and reflective() ;
secondly, changed the RGB of the relective color;
thirdly, mix relective color and refract color and assign it to the 
fragcolor.
3. the position of 10 bubbles are randomly generated
4. make a extra sphere with normal_map texture. there is a "face" on the 
right.
5. change the size of the bubbles and the "face"
6. rotate the "face" so it faces to you
